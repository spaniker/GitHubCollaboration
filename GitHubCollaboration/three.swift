      With worsted weight yarn and a crochet hook, chain 10. Being careful not to twist, place the chain around a hair tie, and join with a slip stitch to form the beginning of a tube.
      Working in spiral rows, make 36 rows of half double crochet. (Make more or fewer rows depending on the size of your hair tie.)
      Cut yarn, leaving a long tail. Use the yarn tail and a blunt tapestry needle to seam together the two ends of the tube. Weave in the ends.
