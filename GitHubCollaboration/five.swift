       FOUNDATION CHAIN: Ch 41(46, 51, 56, 61, 66, 71).
       Crochet chains until you reach the desired length for your top.
       ROW 1: HDC into 2nd ch from hook, HDC in each st until end, turn.
       ROW 2: Ch 1, BLO HDC in each st until last st, HDC in last st, turn.
      Repeat ROW 2 until your panel length = waist measurement.
      Wrap your panel around your body.
      If the edges reach in the middle of your bust and you like the fit, fasten off leaving a tail of yarn (approx. 2 times longer than your foundation chain).
      If you want your top to be looser, add repeats of ROW 2.
            If you want to have a tighter top, remove repeats of ROW 2 until you reach your desired ease.
            Fasten off, leaving a tail of yarn (approx. 2 times longer than your foundation chain).
            Sew the ends of your body panel together. For a more ‘seamless’ look, only sew into the back loops
            Try on your top and using stitch markers or safety pins, mark where you would like your straps to fall.
            Single crochet two straps until desired length is reached and stich into the back panel
